# About Liburry

## The App

This website is a "Progressive Web App", also known as a PWA. Now that you've loaded the site once, any apps you've used in the site will work offline! You can even click "Install" or "Add To Desktop" to install the website as if it was an app on your phone or computer.

## The Code

This website is powered by a code framework named "Liburry", which can be used for generating simple, privacy-first, client-side-only search apps which are available offline in the browser.

Liburry is entirely free, entirely open source, and is built on open source technology. The code can be viewed here: <${REPO_LINK}>
