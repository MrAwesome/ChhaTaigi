# About Chhâ Tâi-gí

The databases used for Taiwanese language search, along with relevant licensing information, can all be found here: <https://github.com/ChhoeTaigi/ChhoeTaigiDatabase/>

The team behind these databases has put years into compiling and classifying them, and this project would never be possible without their hard work. Please consider donating to support their ongoing work in preserving and promoting the Taiwanese language here: <https://www.zeczec.com/projects/taibun-kesimi/orders/back_project>
